# WebMessaging & Predictive Engagment

### Welcome

In this workshop, you will learn how to pass data between a "WebMessenger" session as well as a "Predecitve Engagement" session through to Arcitect as well as the live agent. While both are capable of passinging data (WebMessenger or GPE) there are pros and cons to each method and depending on the use case will depend on the method that is required to be used, so its well worth understanding both methods.

### Why is this important? and to who.

Attached data is critical to understand for reporting, routing usage as well as identification and verification use cases. This workshop is designed for Genesys Cloud administrators as well as web developers that manage the website where WebMessaging and Predictive Engagment are deployed.

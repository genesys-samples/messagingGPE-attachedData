# Tools You'll Need


* ### A Genesys Cloud ORG
    Personally I find the best way to learn is by actually doing this live in your lab environment.

* ### WebMessenger setup
    This is not designed as a WebMessenger setup course. This will need to be already congfigured to route to a queue and agent. Later on you will need to supply the DeploymentId that you are using.

* ### Predective Engagment setup
    This is not designed as a Predective Engagment setup course. This will need to be already congfigured as part of the WebMessenger Snippet.

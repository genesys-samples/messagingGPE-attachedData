# Data Options

I have put these in the order of which I normally would consider them for a customer, but as you will find out its not always the same answer for every customer and use case.

### 1. Predictive Engagement Data (attributes)

GREAT place to start as there is a LOT of rich data OOTB with the default snippet.

### 2. Predictive Engagement Data (record)

For adding custom event data to the web session as well as the Journey timeline.

### 3. WebMessaging (Database.set)

Directly putting "customAttributes" on the conversationId of the WebMessage interaction. The same as the "userData" option that was in V2 WebChat or if your from the Engage world "UData".

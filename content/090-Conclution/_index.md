# Conclusion


## Final Thoughts

So as you can see there are a few options in how you can attach data to a interaction in the digital space. Also the same answer for one customer may not be the same answer for another, based on the use case as well as the stage the data is required to be attached as well as the channels in use. As a starting point I normally recommed looking at them in the order I have these sections in as GPE give a LOT of rich data OOTB without any additional customization as well as is easily avalible in Arcitect and you dont need to rely on a conversationId being present. From there you can then work though the other options, when GPE is in use it is important to understand how the invocation costing is done so you dont create a bad design and push the same data on every pageView event racking up unesseary requests which can create a commercial impact.
